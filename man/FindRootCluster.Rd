\usage{
FindRootCluster(
  cluster_labels,
  flat_embedding,
  dist_graph,
  dist_flat,
  reverse = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster_labels}{the cluster label for each cell}

\item{flat_embedding}{rows are cells and columns are coordinates in n-col space}

\item{dist_graph}{distances on a connected graph}

\item{dist_flat}{flat distance matrix for all cells}

\item{reverse}{a boolean variable whether to take the root cluster based on minimum dispersion on the flat embedding}
}
\value{
a list containing:
    \item{cluster_adj_matrix}{a weighted upper-triangular adjacency matrix for the clusters based on avg pseudotime between their cells}
    \item{graph_cluster}{an igraph object on the clusters, with a minimum spanning tree}
    \item{root_cluster}{index of the root cluster}
    \item{cluster_mst}{an igraph mst object}
}
\description{
Given a weighted adjacency matrix, generate a cluser-to-cluster graph based on a similarity-matrix of connected cells.  Generate the minimum spanning tree on the cluster-to-cluster graph.  Use one of the max dist clusters from this graph, unless:
    The cluster is given, then proceed to find the root cell
    The root cell is given, then use its cluster
