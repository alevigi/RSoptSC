\title{Get the marker genes for each cluster}
\usage{
GetMarkerTable(
  counts_data,
  cluster_labels,
  H = NULL,
  n_sorted = 50,
  gene_expression_threshold = NULL,
  use_H = FALSE,
  lognorm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_data}{a matrix of expression values for each cell (rows) and gene (columns)}

\item{cluster_labels}{a vector of cluster labels}

\item{H}{a nonnegative matrix such that W = H*t(H), H_{i,j} is the cells_weight
by which cell i belongs to the jth cluster}

\item{n_sorted}{the number of markers to report in the n_sorted table}

\item{gene_expression_threshold}{for n cells, for \code{gene_expression_threshold} = m, dont consider genes
expressed in more than n-m cells or genes expressed in less than m cells}

\item{use_H}{whether to use H as loading, default is false, instead using cumulative absolute difference to sort max-mean assigned labels}

\item{lognorm}{perform log transform, normalization, and scaling on the data before the computing the markers}
}
\value{
a list containing 
    \item{all}{all the markers listed by gene index, cluster, and score}
    \item{n_sorted}{a subset of the sorted marker table with gene symbols}
}
\description{
Get the marker genes for each cluster and report their 1-normalized expression value.
